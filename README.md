# Competition
Java project for keeping track of the team members and competition information for school’s annual entries in computer science programming competitions.
Each team consists of exactly four team members and each class is provided with appropriate constructor, accessor, and mutator methods.
In entering data for past competitions, you can note that an entry is usually very similar to the previous year’s entry. To help with the data entry, there is a deep copy constructor 
for the Team class. 
Copy constructor is tested by creating a copy of an existing team object and changing the competition information for the copy, and outputting the data for the original and the copy. The original object should be
unchanged if deep copy constructor is working properly.
